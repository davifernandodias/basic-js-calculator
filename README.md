🚀 Calculator Development in JavaScript 🚀

I'm excited to share my latest project where I was responsible for developing a fully functional calculator using JavaScript. This initiative aimed to create a practical and intuitive tool for carrying out calculations in an efficient and accessible way.

🧮 Highlighted Features:
We have implemented a user-friendly interface that allows users to perform basic mathematical operations and details in a simple way. The calculator supports addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, as well as trigonometric functions and other more complex operations.

💻 Technologies Used:
The project was developed using JavaScript for programming logic and interactivity, HTML for page structure and CSS for responsive design. The application is accessible on different devices, providing a consistent experience.

🌐 Accessibility and Usability:
We pay special attention to accessibility and usability, ensuring the calculator is intuitive for users of all abilities. We adopt responsive design practices to ensure a fluid experience on mobile devices, tablets and desktops.

🚀 Results Achieved:
The JavaScript calculator was a success, providing a practical solution for users who need to perform calculations quickly and reliably. The project reinforced the importance of efficiency in delivering simple and functional solutions.

🌱 Learnings and Improvements:
During development, I gained valuable knowledge in JavaScript, improving my programming and problem-solving skills. I am committed to constant evolution, seeking opportunities to expand and improve the calculator's functionality.

🤝 Next Steps:
I'm excited about the possibilities for expansion and continued improvement of the calculator. I plan to explore additional integrations like calculation history, customizable themes, and support for more math functions.
